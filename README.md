# OOP-Project

## Introduction

### With @roee030 & @OranDanon :tada:

This Is a project from our University, we should do some Wifi measurements, and analyze it using java. 


We did some filtering by Id, location etc.


We also turn the measurements to kml file, such that we could see them on the google earth map. 


Moreover, we can take some files of measurements and make it one. And we make sure that all the files are of the right type. (has the right extension). 


We also make sure that if some measurements have the same mac, it would show it, where it was the strongest. 


If there were more than 10 measurements at each time we show only the 10 strongest measurements. (both at the kml file and CSV). 
In addition, we make sure to enable every character In the kml file. 


We did some testing on our project, and publish the Javadoc. 


We shall make a timeline on the google earth, such that you could see the measurements until some point of a time. 


In this project, each pair should make a code review to two pairs, such that we could learn and criticize each other. And after to fix the problems from the code review 

The example files are the total.csv and total.kml
